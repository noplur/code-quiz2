# Code Quiz
## by Aaron Rosenblatt
#### I created JS, CSS and HTML files from scratch to execute a quiz on coding. The quiz features a timer that counts down, a start button to begin the quiz and a series of questions where the answer is selected with the click of the button. As the questions continue the viewer can see if they answered "correct" or "wrong". If the viewer answeres incorrectly, time is deducted from the quiz. After answering all the questions, the viewer can input their initials, view their score, and see a list of the high scores. I am still working on the quiz but I hope to have it completed this week. I also ran into an issue with GitHub.
